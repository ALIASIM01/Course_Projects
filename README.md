# Course Projects

- For this project, my task was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data it was visualized on the dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks that I have worked with in this project are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
